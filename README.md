# Weather_gui_python_Samyak
Going to make weather broadcasting system(gui) using python and openweather api 

update*

hey Samyak Gupta this side


made this project using GIthub Co pilot

how i used it ?
just by initiating a comment in the ide i can could access the github-co-pilot feature 

90% percent of my code is made by github co pilot auto complete feature

rest of the code i debugged using chat gpt and documentation tkinter
took me approximately 2 hours from the start time to generate the whole code and then debugging adding background
was not able to add more frames due to time limitation
